# Title:

The Financial Correlations of Major Natural Disasters on Insurance Prices

# Abstract:

Insurance is intended to be a protective measure against disasters or unforeseen events. However, large-scale natural disasters can mean insurance companies have to pay out huge sums to affected people, which may lead them to raise prices to recoup their costs. We analyze whether there is any relationship between the large-scale natural disasters (1 billion dollars or more of damage) and insurance prices, specifically property insurance prices, as well as overall insurance prices.

By combining datasets on natural disaster costs and insurance rate indices, we examined potential correlations between the financial impact of disasters and changes in insurance pricing. To standardize comparison, each disaster’s total cost was divided by its duration in months to calculate a “cost-per-month,” which was then applied across all datasets to ensure consistency.

Our analysis, however, indicates no strong linear correlation between the relative price of insurance and the relative cost of natural disasters, even after accounting for potential delayed effects. Severe storms remain the most frequent disaster type, and tropical cyclones still produce the highest overall costs, but these trends do not translate into proportional shifts in insurance prices. Instead, the data shows that both property insurance and overall insurance indices exhibit a strong linear upward trend over time, suggesting that insurance prices continue to rise regardless of the frequency or scale of major natural disasters.

# Introduction

Our analysis aims to determine whether large natural disasters affect insurance prices and whether certain types, like property insurance, are more strongly affected. The main question is whether higher disaster costs correspond to increases in overall insurance rates or in specific insurance rates. Our project examines the correlations between disaster expenses and insurance indices to determine potential market responses. It can offer valuable insight for policymakers, insurance companies, and consumers seeking to understand how natural disasters shape financial risk and insurance affordability.

# Data

We searched online for data relating to insurance prices and the costs of natural disasters. We ended up sourcing our data on insurance prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which keeps of the relative track of the price index of insurance as a whole, as well as property insurance; both were adjusted for inflation. Unfortunately, no other information is provided, and only the relative cost to itself is given. Their downloadable data set contains data from 2009 to 2024.

The data on natural disasters came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a publicly available data set of billion-dollar natural disasters (adjusted for inflation) as far back as 1980. Each one included the event, the type of event, start date of the disaster, end date, as well as inflation adjusted and non inflation adjusted costs. It also had the number of deaths for that disaster. The natural disasters were divided into 6 types: Winter Storms, Wildfires, Tropical Cyclones, Severe Storms, Freezes, Floods, and Droughts

# Data Cleaning:

Neither data set had any missing values, so cleaning it was just a matter of removing sone headers in the csv files that were describing how the data was formatted. The insurance data set contained data points for the relative cost of insurance each month for a total of 195 observations, and the natural disaster data contained 403 observations.

We assigned a cost to each month by dividing each natural disasters' cost by the number of months it spanned, before adding that result to the relevant months. Doing this with each natural disaster in the data set, we were able to assign a "monthly cost" of natural disasters to each month in our insurance data set.

This graph displays the cost of large natural disasters for each given month from 2009 and 2024, in millions. Overall, the cost seems to be relatively low with a few huge outlines Most of these come from hurricanes, as they are the most destructive and often don't span multiple months, and as such their cost is concentrated into a single month for our data. For example the two highest points in 2017 come mainly from Hurricane Harvey (\$160 billion in damage) and Hurricane Maria (\$115 billion in damage), in August and September respectively. However, because of the height of these two points, much of the data is hard to tell apart. As such, below is the same data, except on a log scale.

![Log of the disaster cost per month over time](./graphs/log_disaster_cost_vs_time.png)

Some months had no large natural disasters during their time frame, and as such had 0 as their monthly cost data point. In order to generate this graph, we added 1 to each of the costs so they would be set to 0. However, this should not affect the graph much.

We can see that most natural disasters cause between 500 million to 5 billion dollars in destruction and other costs. If you squint, you may be able to see a positive correlation between time and the cost of diasters, although this correlation seems weak at best.

By examining the relationship between disaster costs and the All Insurance Index using 0-, 6-, and 12-month lags, we see that:

Same-Month: This scatterplot examines whether insurance prices rise immediately in months with expensive disasters. The points don’t show much of a pattern, which suggests that prices don’t react right away. It makes sense as insurers usually adjust rates after assessing the damage, not in the same month. It would be unreasonable to increase insurance rates directly after a severe tragedy.

Lag 6 Months: Shifting disaster costs back by 6 months to assess delayed effects shows a slightly stronger correlation, with higher disaster costs linked to somewhat higher insurance prices half a year later. This suggests the market might take several months to reflect the impact of significant losses. It will likely take even longer to recover from them.

Lag 12 Months/one-year lag: The relationship appears to have weakened or remains similar to the six-month one. The slope and scatter plots look nearly identical. This suggests that most pricing adjustments happen within 6 months and persist, but don’t intensify further by 12 months.

# Analysis

First, we are interested in whether our two ntoable variables--insurance price and damages caused by natural disasters, increase with time. To do so, we conducted a linear regression with time (the given month/year) as our explanatory variable and the months' total damages from natural disasters and relative proeprty insurance prices as our predictor variables.

| Predictor Variable | Explanatory Variable | Coefficient | P-value | R-sq |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Monthly Natural Disaster Damage | Time | 0.0000376 | 0.756 | 0.011 |
| Relative Property Insurance Price | Time | 0.00737 | 2e-16 | 0.907 |

These results indicate the the price of property insurance is linearly correlated with time. Specifically, every month, the price of property insurance is predicted to increase by about 0.74% of the price it was in January of 2009, or about 8.9% of that per year. Unfortunately, since our data only contains relative prices, we don't know the exact amount.

With a p-value of 0.756, we can be confident that the scale of damage from large natural disasters has not increased with time. Seeing how insurance prices seem to rise with time, this means that it is doubtful that insurance prices and natural disaster damage are linearly correlated, but we will run the tests nonetheless.

| Predictor Variable | Explanatory Variable | Coefficient | P-value |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Relative Property Insurance Price | Monthly Natural Disaster Damage | 0.0000431 | 0.245 |
| Relative Property Insurance Price | Log of Monthly Natural Disaster Damage | -0.480 | 0.148 |

Across all both regression models, the p-values were above 0.05, meaning there is no statistically significant linear relationship between natural disaster costs and insurance prices within the same month. However, this could be because the insurance prices may take time to respond to disasters. To confirm this hypothesis, we examine whether stronger associations emerge when introducing 0-month, 6-month, and 12-month lags between disaster costs and insurance price changes.

To test whether there was simply a delay when raising insurance prices when natural disasters caused damage, we took the relative price of insurance after the set delay, divided by the relative price of insurance during which the damage was caused. For example, if Jan. 2012's relative insurance price was 110, and Jan. 2013's relative insurance price was 121, then the relative price would be 121/110 = 1.1 for Jan 2012.

| Predictor Variable | Explanatory Variable | Coefficient | P-value |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Relative Property Insurance Price After 1 Month | Natural Disaster Damage | -7.656e-9 | 0.507 |
| Relative Property Insurance Price After 6 Months | Natural Disaster Damage | 4.478e-9 | 0.912 |
| Relative Property Insurance Price After 12 Months | Natural Disaster Damage | 3.401e-8 | 0.669 |

The minuscule coefficients, high p-values, and R squared values so low that they weren't worth including indicate that there is no relation at all between property insurance prices and the scale/cost of natural disasters, even when accounting for a delay from 1-12 months for insurance prices to rise.

Overall, the weak linear trends observed at all lag lengths help explain why the regression p-values were not statistically significant. Even if there is a slight delayed effect of natural disasters on insurance pricing, the data does not show a strong nor consistent linear relationship.
