## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

load("22_processedData.RData")
```

## Plots

We can compare the property insurance prices to overall insurance prices to see if there's a significant different between the two.

```{r}

plot(all_insurance$Property_Insurance_Index ~ all_insurance$All_Insurance_Index, xlab = "Relative price for all insurance", ylab = "Relative price of property insurance")


```

They seem to have a practically linear relationship, which makes sense. These 2 variable's aren't exactly independent.

```{r}
cor(prop_insurance$Property_Insurance_Index, insurance_data$All_Insurance_Index)
summary(lm(prop_insurance$Property_Insurance_Index ~ insurance_data$All_Insurance_Index))


```

Now we can look at the billion dollar disasters
