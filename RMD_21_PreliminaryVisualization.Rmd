## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
load("12_cleanedData.RData")
head(events_data)
head(insurance_data)
head(prop_insurance)
```

## Plots

We can compare the property insurance prices to overall insurance prices to see if there's a significant different between the two. However, our property insurance includes some data that all insurance doesn't have (2009 march to may), so we have to remove that first

```{r}
prop_insurance <- prop_insurance[-c(1:3),]

plot(prop_insurance$Property_Insurance_Index ~ insurance_data$All_Insurance_Index)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
