```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Processing

```{r}
load("12_cleanedData.RData")
head(events_data)
head(overall_insurance)
head(prop_insurance)
```

Our overall insurance data does not contain the months of March 2009 to May 2009, so we will remove them from the property insurance data so they can match 1 to 1

```{r matchprop}
prop_insurance <- prop_insurance[-c(1:3),]
```

We can now merge the 2 datasets, since they match 1 to 1 in terms of date. We can also get rid of useless columns

```{r}

all_insurance <- merge(prop_insurance, overall_insurance)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
